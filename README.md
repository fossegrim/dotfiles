# dotfiles
## Setup
1. Clone the repository to `$HOME` such that `.git` is at `$HOME/.git`.

2. Run `meta-wizard` which configures the system and walks you through the other wizards.
   ```sh
   ./wizards/meta-wizard
   ```
   Alternatively, or if something fails you can run the wizards individually.
